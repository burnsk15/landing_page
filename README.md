Had a hard time getting the background color, turns out you do not put 'HEX' before the #color like you do with RGB or HLS.

finished the html and css of the header using flex box. I was able to get the header to look like the sample photo in a smaller screen but not while wider. I'm not sure if it is suppose to have adjusting side padding to keep the same look but for now move on to the next part.

# Random information section
I used a div element to be place holders for images. This section has a lot of div's within div. To get the text under the image out both into a div and then apply display:flex, and then flex-direction:column.

# Quote section
I had to add a link the the google fonts to be able to make the Roboto font be thinner than 300.

# Action section
