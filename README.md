A mock web page from scrap to practice HTML CSS and Flexbox together

# desired outcome


# Stratagie 
There is 4 main section, and a footer. Write out the html for one section first and then start adding css elements. Then move to the next section.

# Header section

Had a hard time getting the background color, turns out you do not put 'HEX' before the #color like you do with RGB or HLS.

finished the html and css of the header using flex box. I was able to get the header to look like the sample photo in a smaller screen but not while wider. I'm not sure if it is suppose to have adjusting side padding to keep the same look but for now move on to the next part.

Added flex-basis to keep the header-content from getting to wide.

# Random information section
I used a div element to be place holders for images. This section has a lot of div's within div. To get the text under the image out both into a div and then apply display:flex, and then flex-direction:column.

# Quote section
I had to add a link the the google fonts to be able to make the Roboto font be thinner than 300. Changed the padding to be more that the header area.

# Action section
I had to rename the upper button in the header section with an id "first" for first button, and the the button in this section "last" since it is the last button. 

I used margin in the action parent div to container the blue box away from the edges, while also allowing the box to grow.

I had to remove the margin around both the h3 and p elements and then add a margin around their container so that they would touch.

# Footer
To make the copy symbol use, <span>&copy<span> or <span>&#169<span>.

Also used a footer element instead of a div, since you should use specific containers when possible.

# Notes
After some research I found flex-basis would help me keep the header-content the same size even as the screen gets wider

Also starting halfway through I started adding comments, and went back to add comments, but will try and add more commments going forwards.
